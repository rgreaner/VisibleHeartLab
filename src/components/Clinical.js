					<h4 id="clinicalHeaders">Malignant Hyperthermia Diagnostic Center</h4>
						<p>For detailed information about malignant hyperthermia and its diagnosis, please visit the <a href="https://www.mhaus.org/" >Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States web site</a>.</p>
						<p>The Malignant Hyperthermia Muscle Biopsy Center at the University of Minnesota is aligned with the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Center. We are located in B111 Mayo Building on the east bank of University of Minnesota campus. Our center performed its first diagnostic biopsy in February of 1992. To date (2-8-18), in vitro contracture testing has been performed on muscle biopsies from 134 patients and 36 normal control subjects.</p>

					<h4 id="clinicalHeaders">Policy and Procedure</h4>
						<p>An in vitro contracture test for the determination of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH) will be performed on patients who are viable candidates for testing, and have either agreed to pay for the procedure or have obtained prior approval for the procedure from their insurance companies. Our laboratory is a member of the North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>The procedure consists of the following:</p>
							<h6><strong>I. Consultation/Scheduling</strong></h6>
						<p>Patients may be referred to the Malignant Hyperthermia Muscle Biopsy Center at the University of Minnesota by their physicians or they may contact the center on their own. In either case, contact either Paul A. Iaizzo, PhD, FHRS (612-624-7912), John Capacchione (612-624-9990) or Allison Weyer (612-624-3959) to determine if you are a viable candidate for the in vitro contracture test. If testing is recommended, you will be asked to seek pre-approval for the procedure from your insurance company, or agree to be personally responsible for the costs. The appropriate CPT codes for insurance reimbursement are:</p>

							<h6><strong>II. Muscle Biopsy</strong></h6>
							<p>The muscle biopsy is performed on an outpatient basis. A muscle sample is removed from the vastus lateralis or vastus medialis (thigh) muscles using anesthesia known NOT to trigger malignant hyperthermia. The minimal sample size is about 3-5 cm long and 1-1.5 cm in diameter. A second small muscle sample is removed for histologic study. In addition, each patient is asked to provide a blood sample (10-15 ml) for future genetic analysis, as recommended by the North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry.</p>

							<h6><strong>III. In Vitro Contracture Test</strong></h6>
							<p>The in vitro contracture test is performed in accordance with the guidelines provided by the North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry, and is highly accurate for diagnosing susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. The test is initiated as soon as the muscle sample is available from the patient (fresh tissue is required). Using a dissecting microscope, six to eight small muscle bundles are prepared and then mounted in experimental chambers (see pictures below) and made to contract via electrical stimulation. </p>

							<p>When the anesthetic "halothane" is introduced into the chamber, a muscle that is susceptible to malignant hyperthermia contracts more frequently and develops a contracture (sustained force generation). The drug "caffeine" introduced into the chamber may also lead to an abnormal contracture, as may a variety of other anesthetics. This contracture is indicative of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. Halothane and caffeine contracture tests are performed in triplicate.</p>

							<h6><strong>IV. Test Results and Patient Counseling</strong></h6>
							<p>The results of the contracture test are described to the patient in terms of their muscle's sensitivity to halothane and caffeine in vitro. This test has been considered 95% accurate. </p>
							
							<p>Patients that have a positive contracture test will be advised to wear a medical alert bracelet. In addition, they may wish to follow up with one of our collaborating anesthesiologists to discuss: 1) known genetic details of malignant hyperthermia and new genetic screening procedures; 2) possible testing of other family members; 3) monitoring of serum CK (creatine kinase) levels in potentially susceptible family members; and 4) clinical implications for future anesthetics in malignant hyperthermia positive individuals.</p>

							<h6><strong>V. Molecular Genetic Testing for Malignant Hyperthermia</strong></h6>
							<p>When a person is known to be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (as determined by in vitro contracture testing or a confirmed clinical episode) and subsequent DNA screening has identified an associative DNA mutation, then his/her relatives may be tested through a blood test. In other words, a MH diagnosis can be made with DNA analyses and family members do not need to have the muscle biopsy for confirmation. The DNA molecular testing requires only a blood sample that can be drawn by the patient’s physician, and then sent to a molecular genetic testing laboratory (see below):</p>
